# Delft University of Technology - HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS INFORMED CONSENT 

1. You are being invited to participate in a research study titled "Understanding Annotation Delay Patterns in Social Actions". This study is done by **Alex Jeleniewski, Varun Singh, Xin Wan** and their superviors **Jose Vargas Quiros and Hayley Hung** from the course Seminar Social Signal Processing of TU Delft.

1. The purpose of this research study is to find annnotation delay patterns by analyzing and comparing annotating results between using a binary method(mouse/keyboard) and trigger based method(game controller), and will take you approximately 45 minutes to complete. The data collected here is used for conducting the research and completing our research project. The task is as follows: annotate laughter in 7 5-minute video clips, this can be either done with a game controller or keyboard. After annotation the 7 clips, you will be asked with some post-questions related to the whole process of the experiment as well as your previous experience.

1. As with any online activity the risk of a breach is always possible. To the best of our ability your answers in this study will remain confidential. We minimize any risks by making the whole experiment anonymous, and we do not collect any kind of personal information. We only store the annotation and post-question results that you complete in the experiment. The annotation results contain the intensity of the trigger of the game controller, the starttime and endtime of the trigger press of the controller, the the starttime and endtime of the keyboard press. This data is only be recorded while annotating during the experiment and will not be recorded afterwards.

1. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time during the experiment by closing the webpage. The incompleted data will be automatically deleted.

2. One cannot withdraw after completion of the experiment, as the data is fully anonymous.
